# Description
This is open-source tool for browsing logs. Currently it is designed to browse logs logged by [JsonLogger library](https://github.com/Aviuz/JsonLogger), but in future I want to include other log formats. The idea for this library is to take advatange of object logging and ability to filter logs with dates, levels, and compact display (list-detail view).
